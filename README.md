# Tabs to Sheets
This app allows you to convert any guitar riff to a MIDI file (sheet).  
Remember that tabs **has no time notations**, therefore, you **might not** be able to hear what you were expecting. As a result, **ALL** of the notes are going to be `Quarters`: 1/4  
Open up the .MIDI file in a score editor (such as MuseScore) and fix the time if you really need to.
